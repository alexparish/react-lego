> The building blocks of a react app

This repo demonstrates how to plug in other technologies, one block at a time, into React.

### Hear me out!

The concept is to use GitHub's branch-comparison screens to quickly demo the code changes that are needed for *only* the technology you are interested in.

A client-side React app which is fully tested and production ready on the `master` branch.  
From Master, *Server-side Rendering (SSR)* has been added with  `Koa v2` (for `Express` see [react-lego-2016](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016)).  
Every other branch then adds one more technology, with the smallest possible changes.

All branches, have been setup with [continuous deployment](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego/wiki/Continuous-Deployement).

### What else the Base React app have?

It is production ready and fully tested :

 * [x] CSS ([Sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader), [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer))
 * [x] [tests](/tests/README.md) (unit, functional, end-to-end + smoke)
 * [x] Code linting with [eslint](http://eslint.org/) (CSS + JS linting)
 * [x] CI integration with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
 * [x] Continuous deployment with [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)

*All* other branches include the above and build on this base.

## Technology to Add:

_All branches use [babel v7](https://github.com/babel/babel), [React v16.2](https://github.com/facebook/react), [react-router v4](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack v4](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) unless otherwise stated_
 
The `Code changes` column is where you go if you want to see how the code changed from the previous branch.
 This is a great place to see how to do it yourself.
